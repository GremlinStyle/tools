I am working currently on a complete installation script for openvas inclusive some personal services

<code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GremlinStyle/tools/main/openVas-setup/setup/master-setup.sh -o master-setup.sh;sudo bash master-setup.sh</code>
Or to test next features
<code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GremlinStyle/tools/main/openVas-setup/setup/2.0/master2.0-setup.sh -o master-setup.sh;sudo bash master-setup.sh</code>
